# shellmenu
Menu (menu.sh) is a shell script that can be used as a template to create custom menus.

sqlshadmin.sh is provided as a working example of a possible application based on the shellmenu template. It's intended as a demo for shellmenu so that it's unlikely to be furtherly improved. It requires MySQL to work (sqlshadmin.sh, not any other application based on shellmenu).
